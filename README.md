# World_Weather_Analysis

## Deliverable One Analysis

In Deliverable One we created a database by first  randomly generating 2000 latitudes and
longitudes.  Once we had that we used the the Citypy module to find the nearest city to 
match up with our latitudes/longitudes.  Once the cities were gathered we then used
API's from OpenWeatherMap site to get weather information for each city and created a 
DataFrame

## Deliverable Two

In Deliverable two we used our DataFrame created previously to find the best vacation
cities that would have the tempetures ranging from 70 degrees to 90 degrees.  Once we 
found those cities that met the criteria we then matched up those cities with hotels
for our customer to stay in.  Once again creating a DataFrame that woudl just have
these cities with their hotels.

## Deliverable Three

In Deliverable Three we took that DataFrame from Deliverable two and then created a vacation
itinerary.  We narrows that down to one country and 4 cities that they would use driving
as their mode of transportation.  We then created a map showing their route to each city.
